-- Some Recommendations:
   * Focus on everything related to arrays in tables, including operations like "EXPLODE", how to access elements, transform them, and other related functions.
   * Study advanced SQL features such as "ROLLUP", "CUBE", Common Table Expressions (CTEs), "GROUP BY", and window functions.
   * Pay close attention to features related to visualization, including alerts, filters, and their configuration.
